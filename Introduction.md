<b>INTRODUCTION</b>

According to statistics collected by various government and public agencies, a car accident happens every 60 seconds. Car accidents not only caused financial loss, but also irreplaceable human lives. This project attempts to build a Machine Learning model that can use road and weather conditions to predict probability of a car accident, and whether it will involves property loss and/or human injury.

This model will help both regular and commercial drivers to plan their routes safely and reduce the risk of car accidents.

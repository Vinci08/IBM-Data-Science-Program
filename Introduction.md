<b>INTRODUCTION</b>

According to statistics collected by various government and public agencies, a car accident happens every 60 seconds. Car accidents not only caused financial loss, but also
irreplaceable human lives. This project attempts to build a Machine Learning model that can use road and weather conditions to predict whether a car accident will happen, and
how severe it will be. 

This model will help both regular and commercial drivers to plan their routes safely and reduce the risk of car accidents.
